# Tempurature Data Peaks Analysis Tool
This is the workspace for my Govee Home temperature data analysis tool.

The purpose of this tool is to estimate how often the heating system runs each day and compute the sum total over a downloaded sample period.

## Development
Improvements could be made to automatically ingest a series of files as input to cover a longer time period.
Further heuristics could be implemented to estimate fuel usage and fuel remaining.
Additional logic could incorporate external heating-degree-day information to augment this analysis.
